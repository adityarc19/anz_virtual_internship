# ANZ Virtual internship
This was a data science internship that I did with ANZ company through Insidesherpa. 

- Worked extensively on exploratory data analysis on the given dataset.
- Found key insights from the data that could propel the company's marketing strategies to reach their full potential and in turn cater to the company's most valuable customers and future customers.
